% INNERPROD.M
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% THE SCOPE OF THIS CODE: 
% This Matlab(R) function computes the canonical inner product of two 
% tangent vectors  X and Y at an arbitrary point on the unitary group U(n).
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% USAGE and OPTIONS:
% ip=innerprod(X,Y)
% 
% INPUT:
% X, Y = square matrices of the same size representing tangent vectors
%
% OUTPUT:
% ip = the canonical inner product of two tangent vectors X, Y at a point W
% on the unitary Lie group U(n)
